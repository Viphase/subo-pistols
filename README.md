- ## desciption

  - A camera-tracked game about wild west shootout between two cowboys.

  ![preview](preview_readme.png)

  > You play against your opponent standing in front of you. When the second will say "SHOOT!" you should decide between two options:
  >
  > 1. Take a shot _(by aiming gun gesture to one of the segments of opponents body)_
  > 2. Protect yourself _(by aiming hand gesture to one of the segments of opponents body)_

  - Each cowboy body has 3 segments:

    - Head 🙂
    - Torso 👕
    - Legs 🦵

  - If you all choose gun, the fastest cowboy will win _(the other, unfortunatley loose 1 out of 3 hearts)_. If you all choose to protect - nothing will happen and the second round will begin.
    As you may notice you have 3 hearts (❤️❤️❤️). Loose all = loose a game.
